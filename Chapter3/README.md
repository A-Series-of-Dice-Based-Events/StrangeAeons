# Deams of the Yellow King

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert Title of AP to Pathfinder 2E.

The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.

## Dreamlands Excursion Ritual

DREAMLANDS EXCURSION

RITUAL 4

RARE CONJURATION CREATION OCCULT 

Cast 1 hour; verbal, somatic, focus (a miniature staircase made of polished horn and ivory worth 875 gp)

Primary Check Occultism (expert) or Arcana (expert) DC 29; Secondary Checks Occultism or Arcana

Duration instantaneous; Requirements performed at night on the Material Plane

The casters begin chanting the incantation while they pass around the miniature staircase, feeling each of its 70 steps.
With each passing, the staircase appears a bit heavier and a bit larger. The primary caster drops the miniature staircase on the ground as the incantation is completed.
Success opens a portal where the staircase lands, revealing steps leading downward from wherever the ritual was performed (even if performed upon a rooftop or the deck of a ship). The casters are immediately pulled down in the formed staircase descending it; the Material Plane bodies of the casters are put to sleep and their psyches are thrust into the Dreamlands. Before the completion of the ritual, the primary caster can utter a specific string of words that allows the portal to open in a specific area of the Dreamlands. Otherwise, the portal opens at the Forsaken Caravanserai. In the Dreamlands, the casters manifest lucid bodies identical to their Material Plane bodies.

Success The casters manifest lucid bodies in the dreamland, that are identical to their Material Plane bodies.

Failure As Success, but an [animate dream](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=4546) ambushes them upon arrival.

Critical Failure As failure, but the casters are thrust into the Dreamlands violently, taking 2d6 mental damage.


Waking from the dreamlands takes 3 actions with the concentrate trait, the dreamer needs to make a Will or Fortitude Save (DC 29).

Success The dreamer wakes up in their body.

Failure As Success, but the dreamer gains the stupified 1 condition.

Critical The dreamer does not wake up and can attempt to wake again next turn.

## Part 1 - The Sellen Passage

## D. Lake Kallas

### D1. Dangerous Vagrants (Level 7 Low Threat (60 XP) / Level 8 Trivial Threat (40 xp))

Hanspur Worshipers 
4x Druid Level 4 

Alternatively use 4x Crocodile. The druids transformed into crocodiles and attack, dragging PCs and crew members into the water to drown them, in line with the theme of Hanspur as the "Drowned God". As they retreat, the PCs will see human druids emerge from the water at the shore and disappear into the woods. Although the Crocodiles are only level 2, because of the environment and the high likelihood of being dragged off the boat into the water to be drowned, I considered this to be two tiers higher in difficulty. 

Crocodile

Deep Breath The crocodile can hold its breath for about 2 hours.

### D2. Riverton Revelations 
Naerel Twice-Born 
Human Cleric of Hanspur Level 7 (fighter devotion)

Treasure: Ruby of Leng worth 600 gp

### D3. The Lurking Beast (Level 7 Moderate Threat (80 XP) / Level 8 Low Threat (60 xp))

Use an Elite Bida instead of Ahool. Note the Bida's lore opens the opportunity for intrigue and roleplaying as the PCs attempt to hunt down the cult spawned around the creature left behind by Captain Vadrack, and fits well into the Elder Mythos theme of Strange Aeons.

[Constrict](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=20) Single Action 1d6+8 bludgeoning, DC 28

Eight Coils A bida can Strike with its tail even while Grabbing creatures with it. The bida can have up to eight Medium or smaller creatures grabbed with its tail at a time; it can also grab Large creatures, but they count as four Medium creatures for this purpose.

Mask Settlement (arcane, illusion) By concentrating for 4 hours, the bida hides a small settlement. This is a 5th-level hallucinatory terrain spell, except the area is a 500-foot burst and creatures are invisible while inside structures in the area. The bida can conceal only one settlement at a time, and must concentrate on the effect for 10 minutes at the beginning of each day to maintain the illusion.





## Part 2 - Dream Quests
Notes: Party is assumed to be level 7 or 8 in this chapter and Chapter 1

## Last Night on Sarnath

### L1. The Feasting Hall (Level 7 Low Threat (60 XP) / Level 8 Trivial Threat (40 xp))
2x Ib Shades

https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/StrangeAeons/blob/master/ib_shade.pdf

https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/StrangeAeons/blob/master/ib_shade.png

### L2. The Mist (Level 7 Moderate Threat (90 XP) / Level 8 Low Threat (60 xp))
3 [Will o' Wisps] (https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=414)

### L3. Idol Bearers (Level 7 Severe Threat (110 XP) / Level 8 Moderate Threat (80 xp))
1x Ib Shade
1x Priest of Bokrug

https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/StrangeAeons/blob/master/priest_of_bokrug.pdf

https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/StrangeAeons/blob/master/priest_of_bokrug.png

### Bokrug Arrives

### Bokrug 
I didn't bother with complete stats for Bokrug. Relevant features: 
Bokrug arrives 300 ft. away. 
Bokrug moves 60 ft. per round. 
Bokrug busts out the pimp hand and smacks fools with a +30 to hit for 2d8+20 damage. 
Bokrug uses control weather to trap the PCs per the adventure path. 
Bokrug has an unspeakable presence aura of 300 ft. Every turn within the unspeakable presence (300 ft) DC 30 Will save or Stupified, Fleeing, Frightened, or Confused (At random or GM's choice). 
(Alternatively use sanity rules: Every turn within the unspeakable presence Aura, Insanity 1 increase. Insanity 2 = lesser madness, insanity 4 = greater madness, use these rules for inspiration on what madnesses might mean. https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/sanity/. Insanity can be reduced by counteract through restoration spell (spell class vs. Character's level DC) or 1 week of rest (will vs. Character's Level DC) (Crit - reduce by 2/ Success reduce by 1/ fail no reduction / Crit fail increase by 1). When the Insanity falls below the threshold the madness becomes dormant). 

### Doom Idol

The bearer can cast Horrid Wilting once per day, but must include herself as a target.

Possessing the Idol for over 24 hours, studying it for ten minutes, or using the Horrid Wilting effect causes the bearer to become immune to the Stupified and Confused conditions (alternatively, the bearer gains insanity 2 but cannot gain higher levels) and the bearer becomes susceptible to Bokrug's Vengeful Dreams ability.

## H. BACK TO THE CARAVANSERAI 
Designed for 4 Level 9 PCs

### H1. Caravanserai Exterior

### H2. Guard Station (Trivial/Low Threat)

### H6. Shop (Trivial / Low Threat)
1x [Animate Dream](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=546)

Replace Symbol of Weakness trap with the following: 

Five Leng Rubys around the room cause nightmare visions to those who look at the gem. The animate dream shopkeeper uses the confusion caused by the rubys to attack the PCs. If he can defeat one of the PCs, he can be freed from being trapped at the shop, and the defeated PC will take his place. The impact of this is up to the GM. 

Nightmare Vision Leng Ruby

### P7. Administration (Severe Threat)
Replace Moon-Beast with 
1x [Chernobue Qlippoth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=775)

Black Soul Shard Level 7
Necromancy Occult Consumable Talisman Magical

This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature’s life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more levels of the drained condition, the black soul shard absorbs one of these levels into itself, reducing the condition by one.  

Absorbing a negative level destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for 24 hours for it to function again. A creature can only have one black soul shard attuned to it at a time.

### P8. Records Room

Kelvetta's gear
+1 Striking Longbow

Orsephelius: 
Use [Elite Peluda](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=756)

Note: once Orsephelius is at 50% HP (or 25% HP and the torture devices are destroyed), she steps into a shadow and disappears. She will wait outside for the PCs and attack them where she has more room to maneuver. 

Living Torture Devices:
Use 4x [Animate Statues](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=20)

Treasure: 
Spectacles of Understanding
Use [Goggles of Night](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=438)

Death Scream Preserving Apparatus
While it is operative: 
Every turn, living creatures (except those who have become accustomed to it by exposure for over 24 hours) within 50 feet must attempt a DC 28 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.

Use 1x [Munagola](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1115) and 1x [Phistophilus](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=112)

These two (a contract demon and an executioner demon) have entered into a profitable arrangement with Ahrhk-Nar: he tortures the prisoners see how much they can withstand. At what point will they sign a contract with a demon, binding their souls, in order to escape their fleshly torment? Once they have signed their souls away, their current torment is quickly ended, as the Munagola executes them. But what torment awaits them the realm of the devils? 

The piped screams are louder and the effect is stronger here: use the stats from the Torture chamber, but increase the DC to 28.

### P18. Music Room (Severe Threat)

1x [Chernobue Qlippoth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=775)
