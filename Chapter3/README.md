# Deams of the Yellow King

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert Title of AP to Pathfinder 2E.

The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.

### Bokrug Arrives

### Bokrug 
I didn't bother with complete stats for Bokrug. Relevant features: 
Bokrug arrives 300 ft. away. 
Bokrug moves 60 ft. per round. 
Bokrug has an unspeakable presence aura of 300 ft. Every turn within the unspeakable presence (300 ft) DC 30 Will save or Stupified, Fleeing, Frightened, or Confused (At random or GM's choice). 
(Alternatively use sanity rules: Every turn within the unspeakable presence Aura, Insanity 1 increase. Insanity 2 = lesser madness, insanity 4 = greater madness, use these rules for inspiration on what madnesses might mean. https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/sanity/. Insanity can be reduced by counteract through restoration spell (spell class vs. Character's level DC) or 1 week of rest (will vs. Character's Level DC) (Crit - reduce by 2/ Success reduce by 1/ fail no reduction / Crit fail increase by 1). When the Insanity falls below the threshold the madness becomes dormant). 

### Doom Idol

The bearer can cast Horrid Wilting once per day, but must include herself as a target.

Possessing the Idol for over 24 hours, studying it for ten minutes, or using the Horrid Wilting effect causes the bearer to become immune to the Stupified and Confused conditions (alternatively, the bearer gains insanity 2 but cannot gain higher levels) and the bearer becomes susceptible to Bokrug's Vengeful Dreams ability.
